			<p>This suit of armor is painted with gold, blue and white details, as well as having a mysterious magic infusing it. The armor can hold up to 5 charges. Whenever an attack misses you you gain 1 charge, but no more than once per turn. At the end of combat, all remainig charges are converted into 3 temporary Hp each.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Skyward Guard.</em></strong> Holding a single charge grants a bonus +1 to AC. At 3 charges this bonus raises to +2 and at 5 charges the bonus rises to +3.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Wind's Rebuke</em></strong> With 3 or more charges, when an melee attack misses you,as a reaction you can unleash a gust of wind to push the attacker 10ft away (consumes 2 charges)</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Cloudform Shift</em></strong> At 5 charges the next melle attack made against you simply passes through, as if you were momentarily made of mist (consumes all charges)</p>
